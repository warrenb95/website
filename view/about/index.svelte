              Hi I'm Warren! I'm a backend software engineer based in the south
              east of England.

            <li>
              I graduated the University of Brighton in 2022 and have been
              working since then as a backend developer in golang, working on
              microservice architectures deployed on kubernetes and
              containterized with docker.
            </li>
            <li>
              The purpose of this website is to act as a dumping ground for
              things that I've learnt in my last 2 years as well as things I'm
              currenltly learning about or things that I'm struggling with as an
              backend engineer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm planning to try and update the website every 2 weeks and will
              add a log of the updates made so you can follow along ðŸ˜„ Thanks
              for stopping by and I hope you enjoy!
