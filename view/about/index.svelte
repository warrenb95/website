              Hi I'm Warren! I'm a backend software engineer based in the south
              east of England.

            <li>
              I graduated the University of Brighton in 2022 and have been
              working since then as a backend developer in golang. I work on
              microservices deployed to kubernetes and containterized with
              docker.

              The purpose of this website is for it to be a dumping ground for
              things that I've learnt in my last 2 years as well as things I'm
              currenltly learning about, or things that I'm struggling with as a
              backend engineer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm planning to update the website every 2 weeks and will add a
              log of the updates made so you can follow along ðŸ˜„ Thanks for
              stopping by and I hope you enjoy!
