## Simple bud server

I stumbled across this [go](https://go.dev/) project called [bud](https://github.com/livebud/bud) that looked very interesting having worked with other languages before that had their own full stack solutions like [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
Bud looked like a cool project and I'd been planning on building a fullstack website to host blogs and logs of things that I'm learning about or solutions to software engineering related issues; essential a brain dump of everything relating to programming, architecture, ci/cd and cloud.

I won't go into the details of how to implement a bud server as this blog isn't focused on that. I'd recommend you check out the github [repo](https://github.com/livebud/bud) for the video tutorial and links to the documentation. 
My bud application at the start is very simple and consists of a single page with a nav bar, title and small paragraph explaining that this is my website and I'm planning to post/update it every 2 weeks. I also used [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to style the website because I'm very lazy and am not a front end developer ðŸ˜„

## Docker file

To be able to run the app anywhere in the simplest way possible I decided to containerize it and run it on [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
This would allow me to run the app anywhere that docker installed, I won't have to worry about installing programming languages, dependencies or anything else; just install docker and run the container.
I was lucky enought to find a [docker file](https://github.com/livebud/bud/blob/main/contributing/Dockerfile) on the bud repo and I used this as my base, I then added a couple extra commands to expose port `:3000` and run the application.

## AWS setup

### EC2

I went for the quickest/simplest approach and that was to just create an ec2 instance on AWS and manually set up the server. If you don't know what an [ec2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console) instance is it's a virtual machine running on AWS infrastructure.
This allows me to create a virtual machine running linux and then install all the software I need onto it and serve my website.
The first thing I installed was [docker](https://www.docker.com/) which would allow me to run the container image that we previously created, and by using docker to host the app on the ec2 instance I don't have to install any other software, I just need to run a command like this `docker run -it -d --name website {my_image}` and docker will handle the rest.

Now that the website is running on a machine I need someway to access this ðŸ¤”. How?
To access the ec2 instance I could create a simple ec2 [security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html) to allow all HTTP traffic on any port to connect to the ec2 instance and therefore connect to the website. This would work but then there comes the issue of scaling the website.

### Load Balancing

So what I should have done next is create an auto scaling group, I could then have built a template by snapshoting the previously created ec2. The auto scaling group could then spin up new instances if say the average CPU load was >80%. I didn't do this though, but I'll defineteley add this in at some point soonish.
I set up an application load balancer ALB, this would then allow me to configure how the traffic was routed depending on the HTTP port for example. I created a listener on the ALB that would listen for HTTPS traffic on port 443, I also had to set up TLS (transport layer security) certificates using [AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/index.html). This listener would then forward all traffic to a target group that will route incoming traffic to port `:3000` on my ec2 instance (this will later be my auto scaling group), the port `:3000` is just the port that `BUD` defaults to so I just kept it for now.

I could now access my website using this DNS name `BlogALB-827866070.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com` (this worked as of 12 Jan 2023), this URL is crap and no one (including me) will never remember this. So how can we update this to have a 'normal' looking URL?

## Route 53

[Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html) is an AWS service that allows you to register domain names, create a hosted zone and then route traffic on your domain to other AWS services of any IP address of your choice. So I registered the domain name `warrenb95.com` and boom ðŸ’¥ I know have my own domain name and with some Route 53 magic I was able to route traffic from the domain DNS to the ALB.

This is pretty much the current state of the website. If you wanna learn more about how to do this then I'd highly recommend this [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/), this is what I'm currently going through and learning lots about AWS and how to use the services to host my own website.


## Conclusion

To wrap this up what I've done so far is:
1. Create a simple webserver with golang and bud
2. Created a dockerfile to containerize the app so that I can run it basically anywhere
3. Set up an ec2 instance and pulled on the docker container and started the server
4. Create an ALB and routed traffic to my ec2 instance
5. Registered my domain `warrenb95.com` and then created DNS records to route the traffic to my ALB
